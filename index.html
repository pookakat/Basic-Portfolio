                    <p>I am a former customer service representative with decades of experience, encompassing inbound and outbound customer service, technical support, billing, and employee benefit support, as well as face-to-face billing support. I have also served in a supervisory capacity for a team of twenty representatives through Apple's iPhone technical support center. </p>
                    <p>The dedication to quality and proper communication, honed in my roles in customer service translated well into a position as a Test Automation Engineer at Scripps Networks. My ability to communicate to a vast array of people, from senior developers to product owners gave me a firm foundation towards testing new applications for Scripps' various web sites and advertising campaigns. I also assisted in migrating all content from the in-house CMS to a more modern and easy to develop AWS environment. </p>
                    <p>It was at Scripps that I found my true love towards web development. After completing my contract, my husband and I moved back to the Raleigh-Durham area, and the search to return to a more technical role began. Soon, we found our way to UNC's Coding Bootcamp, and my journey to become a developer truly began.</p>
                    <p>Detail driven, team-oriented, with a growth mindset, I went to UNC's Coding Bootcamp to hone my skills further develop my knowledge to become Super Developer, defender of semantics and champion of proper grammar.</p>
